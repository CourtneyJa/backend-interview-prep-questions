# Backend interview preparation

In this repository you'll find two files, `actors.sql` and `movies.sql`. They comprise titles and actors from the top 250 movies from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). For simplicity's sake, it is not fully normalized. We will not be using this particular dataset during your onsite, but you can use it to familiarize yourself with SQLite and make sure you can access it from your preferred language.

## Preparing for the onsite

Make sure you've installed `sqlite` on your machine, and, if necessary, a library or driver to access SQLite programmatically using the language of your choice. Some languages have SQLite support built-in, and some don't.

We want you to feel prepared for the on-site. Before you arrive, be able to answer the following questions using the dataset we've provided:

1. What is the longest-running movie?
2. What movie has the most actors?
3. What is the breakdown of top movies by rating?
